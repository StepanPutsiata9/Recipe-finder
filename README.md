# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## 📋 Technical Requirements

To ensure the project runs and develops correctly, you will need:

- **Node.js**: version `20.x` (LTS) or higher.
- **Package manager**: `npm` or `yarn`.
- **Expo Go**: a mobile app on your device (iOS/Android) for quick testing.
- **Emulators (optional)**: Android Studio or Xcode for running the app on your computer.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
